# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

In this project, we were tasked with creating a work day scheduler using libraries such as moment and jquery. We used moment to set dates and pull times, where jquery helped us traverse the DOM with ease (and a lot less code). This project was much easier than the last, now that we have had time to learn about local storage and jquery syntax. Overall, I enjoyed using libraries to get the site done. It was fun to learn about different syntax in different environments.
